Although feedback generated was invaluable for developing interventions to improve organizational health, it was often a retrospective snapshot in time. For those leaders who want to monitor the pulse of their organizations on a realtime, continuous, and contemporaneous basis, the AI-driven TruPulse platform is a highly effective strategy. TruPulse is tantamount to having a KardiaMobile EKG continuous heart rate monitor to check the pulse of an organization’s top line—employees.",
